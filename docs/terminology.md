In Notion everything is either a `page` or a `block`. An important and special block is a `database` which can be
within a page, i.e. *inline*, or at the same hierarchy level as a `page`. A `database` has a *schema* that
specifies various structured *properties* of the individual pages contained in this database. Only pages
contained in a database have properties. Regardless of the properties, each page has *attributes* such as a title,
cover, icon, or whether it is archived or not.
