# Introduction to pages

Pages are one of the most essential building blocks of Notion.
A page has certain *attributes* such as a title, cover, icon, and wether it is deleted
(archived in the bin) or not.
Items within a database, or rows if you will, are just pages and the schema of the database,
that is the set of columns and their types, imposes *properties* on each contained page.

Beside attributes and properties, a page also has a *content*, consisting of *blocks* for text
and everything you can chose in the Notion UI by hitting <kbd>/</kbd>. As a page can be contained
in another page, we can have a *parent* and *children* relation between pages.
Check out the [Page object] to find out more about accessing these functionalities.
